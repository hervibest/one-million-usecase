# 🚀 Insert One Million Data from CSV using Golang Goroutine Worker

A high-performance CSV ingestion tool built with **Golang**, designed to insert **one million+ records** into a **PostgreSQL** database using **goroutines**, **worker pools**, and **PGX**.

This project focuses on **high concurrency**, **efficient DB connection pooling with PGX**, and follows a **simple clean architecture** pattern. It also uses **Fiber** as a lightweight web framework, making it easy to extend into a RESTful API service.
